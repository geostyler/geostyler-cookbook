# **Symbolizer Type**

`Mark` represents the visualization of `Point` data.

Point is a simple geometry type, even though it has position as a coordinates attached to it, we can certainly style it using various ways using  [Geostyler](https://geostyler.org/) 

# **UI of styler**

Once data is loaded, [Geostyler](https://geostyler.org/) automatically detects the geometry type and tries to set it up, click in column of *paint bucket*

`Mark` supports various properties to create perfect styling for Points.

For each change in the properties, you can see preview

## Symbols

`Mark` supports various symbol lists right out of the box such as `circle`,`square`,`triangle`,`star`,`cross`,`x` , it also provides shapes such as `backslash` , `carrow`, `dot`, `horline`, `oarrow`, `plus`, `slash`, `times`, `vertline`.

Values can be set between **0 - 1**, where 0 means transparent and 1 means opaque


## Stroke-Width

`Stroke-Width` is used to set thickness of the border

## Rotation

Using `Rotation`, user can rotate the symbol at given value in degree
